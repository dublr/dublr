# Audit results

Both Dublr and OmniToken have successfully passed two different 3rd party security audits:

* SolidProof
  * [Audit report and certificate](https://github.com/solidproof/projects/tree/main/Dublr): "Complying with SolidProof AAA Cyber Security Standard"
  * [Local copy of audit report](./SmartContract_Audit_Solidproof_Dublr.pdf)
* Omniscia
  * The Omniscia audit was passed with the highest security classification, and the audit was extensive; however, Omniscia has not posted the final audit report to their site for some reason, and they have not been responding to messages for months. I cannot in good faith recommend this auditor based on the poor customer experience, even though the audit quality was good.
  * I have access to a preliminary security report from Omniscia, and I can provide this on request, but there is no public URL that I can link to yet.
