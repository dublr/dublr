Deploying:

Deploy a Dublr contract on Ethereum and a corresponding OmniToken contract on Polgyon (or other chain).

Verify both contracts on Polygonscan and Etherscan.

To enable Multichain routing:

    - Listing the two contracts as a Multichain swap pair:
        https://docs.multichain.org/for-partners/for-partners/faq
        https://dard6erxu8t.typeform.com/to/C7RwF08A?typeform-source=multichain.org

    - On Ethereum Dublr/OmniToken contract, call:
            _owner_authorizeMinter(addr, true)
            _owner_authorizeBurner(addr, true)
        where addr is the Ethereum Multichain router address obtained from the listing request above.

    - On secondary chain contract, call:
            _owner_authorizeMinter(addr, true)
            _owner_authorizeBurner(addr, true)
        where addr is the secondary chain Multichain router address obtained from the listing request above.

To enable Polygon PoS bridging:

    - On Ethereum Dublr/OmniToken contract, call:
            _owner_authorizeMinter(addr, true)
        where addr is MintableAssetProxy (which has PREDICATE_ROLE in the Polygon example code):
        This allows the MintableAssetProxy to call `mint(address to, uint256 amount)`.

    - On Polygon OmniToken contract, call:
            _owner_authorizeMinter(addr, true)
        where addr is ChildChainManager (which has DEPOSITOR_ROLE in the Polygon example code):
        This allows the ChildChainManager to call `deposit(address user, bytes calldata depositData)`.

    - Submit a Polygon mapping request at https://mapper.polygon.technology/
        - Leave the child contract field blank in the form
        - Choose the Mintable option in the form
