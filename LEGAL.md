# Legal Agreement and Disclaimers for Dublr and OmniToken

By electing to mint, buy, sell, gift, transmit, store, or otherwise use Dublr tokens (collectively, by electing to use the Dublr token, or by electing to use any functionality implemented by the Dublr or OmniToken smart contract), you agree to all of the following:

**Forward-looking statements:** You agree that nothing in the Dublr or OmniToken documentation or source code can or will be construed as financial advice, financial guidance, an asset prospectus, or a financial prediction. Any forward-looking statements in the Dublr or OmniToken documentation or source are purely speculation, and should not be relied upon as a prediction of market behavior.

**No promise of profits by the issuer:** No profit or return is guaranteed, promised, or predicted as a result of the purchase or use of DUBLR tokens. It is impossible to predict actual market behavior, and DUBLR tokens can sell at any price below the mint price: the mint price is only an upper bound to price (enforced by increasing total supply, which is deflationary); there is no lower price bound. The actual future price of Dublr tokens is governed by market forces, which are unpredictable. Investing is an inherently risky activity, and you agree that all responsibility for investing in or using Dublr tokens is borne by you as the investor.

**Not a store of value:** You agree that the Dublr token is simply a virtual asset, without any equivalent monetary value or utility, and is not a store of value. You will not construe the mint price or the sale price of Dublr tokens, as implemented by the Dublr smart contract, to represent any particular fiat-equivalent or monetarily-equivalent value. There is no guarantee that any purchased Dublr tokens will ever be worth anything, will be usable for any purpose, or will be redeemable for any amount of another currency such as ETH. Any value that you choose to associate with Dublr tokens is your own responsibility, and carries inherent risk of unpredictability and volatility.

**Legal use of DUBLR only:** You will not use the Dublr token or the Dublr `buy` or `sell` functions to launder money or circumvent Anti Money Laundering (AML) laws, or to engage in any form of criminal or illegal activity. You will follow all tax laws, financial laws, and security/exchange laws of any legal jurisdiction in which you use the Dublr token. In particular, you confirm that the Dublr token is not considered an unregistered or illegal security, and that the Dublr smart contract is not considered an unregistered or illegal exchange, by the laws of any legal jurisdiction in which you hold or use the Dublr token. Also remember that like all Ethereum-based tokens, all actions taken with DUBLR tokens or the Dublr smart contract are logged and visible on the blockchain forever, and are therefore traceable by government and law enforcement.

**Tax law abidance:** In some jurisdictions, such as the United States, any use, transfer, or sale of a cryptocurrency token is a taxable event (in the US, cryptocurrency is taxed as property). It is your responsibility to record the purchase price and fair market value at time of sale, in ETH or your local currency equivalent, for each use, transfer, or sale of Dublr tokens or OmniToken tokens you own. You agree to abide by all applicable tax laws, and to pay all taxes due.

**Security and auditing:** You acknowledge that the usage of any smart contract carries an inherent risk of security problems and vulnerabilities. Every effort has been made to ensure that the Dublr contract (and the OmniToken contract) are ultra-secure, bug-free, and safe to use, including via unit testing, static analysis (by SolHint and Slither), auditing, and some formal verification methods; however, it is the responsibility of each user of the Dublr contract to verify for themselves that the Dublr and OmniToken contracts are secure before utilizing these contracts. Full sourcecode is provided on [GitHub](https://github.com/dublr/dublr) for Dublr and OmniToken, and this source has been verified by Etherscan to legitimately represent the deployed contract.

**No warranty, and indemnification:** The creator of Dublr makes no warranty, express or implied, as to the safety, security, price, value, exchangeability, or utility for any purpose, of Dublr tokens or the Dublr smart contract. You assume full responsibility for any loss or damage incurred from the usage of the DUBLR tokens or the Dublr smart contract, including the underlying OmniToken library. You release the creator of Dublr and OmniToken, and the operators of any exchanges that support the usage of Dublr tokens, from all legal responsibility related to your use of DUBLR tokens and the Dublr smart contract. By using DUBLR tokens or the Dublr smart contract, you agree that neither you nor anyone representing your interests will ever initiate legal proceedings against the creator of Dublr, or against any party operating a network or exchange that supports the Dublr token.

**Fees:** By buying or selling Dublr tokens using the built-in decentralized exchange (DEX), buyers agree to pay minting fees if new tokens are minted (minting fees are an irreversible exchange of the buyer's supplied ETH value for DUBLR tokens), and sellers agree to pay market maker fees if tokens are sold (market maker fees are irreversibly deducted from the ETH amount sent from the buyer to the seller when tokens in a seller's order are sold to the buyer). As a buyer or seller, you acknowledge that there will be no refund of market maker fees or minting fees under any circumstances.

**Authoritativeness:** Where there is a disagreement between any documentation associated with the Dublr token or the Dublr smart contract and this legal disclaimer, the legal disclaimers in this section ("Legal Agreement and Disclaimers for Dublr and OmniToken") will be deemed to be authoritative, overriding any conflicting information. Anything below this line is opinion only.

# Legality (OPINION ONLY)

The following is a simple legal opinion as to the legality of the DUBLR token and the Dublr smart contract, based on existing US securities and exchange laws, and legal precedent. However, the disclaimers above are authoritative: DUBLR may still be considered a security, and/or the Dublr contract may be considered an exchange, in your legal jurisdiction, including in the United States.

**Therefore, the following should not be considered as legal advice or a legal indemnification for usage of DUBLR tokens or the Dublr smart contract.** Seek your own legal advice to determine if you can use Dublr in you legal jurisdiction, including in the US. You must abide by all your local securities and exchange laws, and tax laws.

## The DUBLR token is not a security by US SEC definition

* By the [Howey test](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/howey-test.asp), the Dublr smart contract is not an investment contract, and therefore is not a security, according to the laws of the US SEC:
  * There is _no promise of profit from the purchase of DUBLR tokens, and there should be no expectation of profit from the purchase of DUBLR tokens_, because DUBLR tokens can sell at any price below the mint price. The mint price only provides a hard _upper_ bound to the sale price of tokens, not a lower bound. Token supply is increased on-demand to enforce this upper bound, and minting is an inherently deflationary action.
  * No promise, express or implied, has been given about the profitability of DUBLR by the creator of the Dublr smart contract.
  * No expectation of profit can be *"derived from the efforts of others"*, since the Dublr smart contract, once launched, runs on the blockchain fully autonomously, without supervision or intervention.
    * Dublr was not deployed as a proxied contract, so the code cannot be updated or changed by the developer or deployer of the contract. After the Dublr smart contract is deployed, no further development or improvement of the network is possible. The DUBLR token and the Dublr smart contract were not deployed before code completion, so no functionality was available or provided before deployment, and no further development or maintainership has been or could be conducted after deployment.
    * Any efforts by the creator and deployer of the DUBLR token via the Dublr smart contract are purely ministerial (publishing non-prospectus and non-promotional information via Twitter, for utility purposes only) and not managerial.
  * Therefore, no effort is expended by the deployer of the Dublr contract to maintain the Dublr service, and any purchasers of DUBLR tokens cannot expect the assetâ€™s value to increase based on future efforts of a developer or operator.
* Also by the [Clayton test](https://coinnotes.news/2018/06/07/bitcoin-is-not-a-security-sec-chairman-jay-clayton/), the DUBLR token is not a security:
  * During the development of the Dublr smart contract, the Dublr developer never solicited funds from third parties for a common venture.
  * The Dublr developer does not promise future rewards to investors, and does not warranty the value or fitness of DUBLR tokens for any purpose.
* The DUBLR token is not a [SAFT (Simple Agreement for Future Tokens)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/simple-agreement-future-tokens-saft.asp), because it is not an investment contract, and no agreement is made to provide future tokens.
  * New tokens are minted immediately, on demand, for buyers when there are no tokens listed for sale at a price below the mint price.
  * Tokens are transferred immediately from sellers to buyers in the case of a sale on the built-in distributed exchange.
* Minting of new coins by the Dublr smart contract is *not an ICO*, because there is no initial offering.
  * Minting is an ongoing process with potentially limitless supply, until 30 doubling periods have passed (~7.5 years), at which time the supply of tokens is fixed forever.
* DUBLR token ownership does not constitute equity ownership of the Dublr smart contract or any other asset.
* There is further discussion [here](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets) about what constitutes a security.

### The Distributed Exchange (DEX) built into Dublr is not an exchange by US SEC definition

* The trading platform built into Dublr is referred to as a DEX only by common convention, and this [should not be taken to imply](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/enforcement-tm-statement-potentially-unlawful-online-platforms-trading) that the Dublr smart contract is registered or regulated by the SEC as a trading platform or exchange.
* Because *the Dublr DEX trades only DUBLR tokens, and because DUBLR tokens are not securities,* as outlined above, the Dublr smart contract is not an exchange by the [standards of the SEC](https://www.sec.gov/news/public-statement/enforcement-tm-statement-potentially-unlawful-online-platforms-trading), and the Dublr DEX does not serve as an intermediary in securities transactions. The Dublr DEX is a passive communications system that assists in transactions but does not play a role in effecting transactions in securities.
* Exchange Act Rule 3b-16 [specifies](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/17/240.3b-16) that an exchange "brings together orders for securities of multiple buyers and sellers".
  * The Dublr smart contract presents only _one_ buyer (not multiple buyers) at a time with the opportunity to buy one or more sell orders from one or more sellers.
  * Dublr does not allow buyers to place buy orders, it implements only the sell side of the market, and buyers can elect to purchase sell orders. Therefore Dublr does not perform all the functions commonly performed by an exchange.
  * Dublr sell orders may be canceled at any time by the seller, therefore sell orders on the Dublr DEX do not constitute "firm orders" by some definitions.
* The Dublr DEX does not facilitate or effectuate transactions for the account of others, but rather facilitates peer to peer trades between private parties.
  * The Dublr DEX does not assist parties in negotiating transactions; transactions are fully disintermediated by means of being fully decentralized and fully automated.
  * The owner of the DUBLR contract has no ability to directly intermediate in or control any trade between two private parties using the Dublr DEX.
  * No actor "uses" non-discretionary methods to settle transactions using the Dublr DEX.
* The creator and deployer of Dublr is not an Active Participant (AP) by the [SEC's definition](https://www.sec.gov/corpfin/framework-investment-contract-analysis-digital-assets), including the following. Once deployed, the Dublr contract is fully decentralized, and the deployer has no further oversight or active participation over trades. Specifically the creator and deployer of the Dublr contract does not satisfy at least the following conditions:
  * "There are essential tasks or responsibilities performed and expected to be performed by an AP, rather than an unaffiliated, dispersed community of network users (commonly known as a "decentralized" network)" -- once deployed, all usage of the Dublr smart contract is decentralized.
  * "An AP has a continuing managerial role in making decisions about or exercising judgment concerning the network or the characteristics or rights the digital asset represents" -- the code of the Dublr contract is fixed, so ability to exercise judgment to change the fundamental logic of the contract after it is deployed.
* There is further discussion [here](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/crypto-exchanges-the-sec-s-proposed-9029987) on what constitutes an exchange.
